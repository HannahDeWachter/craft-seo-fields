# Field

The plugin assumes that the handle of the `SEO Fields` field will be simply: __`seo`__. If it can't find that field, it won't output anything.

If you use a different handle for your field, simply copy [this file](src/config.php) to the `config` directory of your project and change the fieldhandle to your own. 

### Field settings
In the field settings you can enable or disable the following:
- Show the general tab
- Show the facebook tab
- Show the twitter tab

Under the advanced options you can:
- Enable the option to hide the site title
- Enable the option to hide the site title
