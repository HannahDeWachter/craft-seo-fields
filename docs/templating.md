# Templating
To put SEO Fields on your html, just add `{% hook 'seo-fields' %}` within the `<head>` tag in your layout.
 If you want more control over what the plugin output, you can include your own snippet instead of the templat hook. Have a look at the [default template](src/templates/_meta.twig) to get you started.
